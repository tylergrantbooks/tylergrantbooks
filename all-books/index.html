				<h1>Brights</h1>
				<p>On a frigid November night, four hard-partying teenagers try to leave a party in a souped up Z28 Camaro. After a run in with the law, and a back road lesson on how to drive a stick, they are accosted by a wild-man in a jacked up 4x4 pickup with KC lights bright enough to blind anyone who crosses their path. The man is relentless, doing everything he can to force them off the road. Why? No one knows… until… after the crash.</p>

				<h1>Secret in the Attic</h1>
				<p>Sleepy Garland, Montana is stirred to life when a twenty-year murder mystery is put back under the microscope. Garland’s elders have swept the disappearance of Marcy Shepherd under the rug, but young Atlas Martin stumbles upon new evidence that links Marcy’s husband to the crime. Atlas, who stays nights on Pike Shepherd’s ranch, is made to fear for his life as tension mounts. Will Atlas find the proof he needs… or will Shepherd strike again, silencing another scream… Tyler Grant delivers a barn-burner young adult novel that will captivate young and mature audiences alike. Secret in the Attic is a modern western like you've never experienced before.</p>
